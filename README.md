A little program I wrote that checks what percent of the time each number from 1 through 10 shows up when using the python random number generator. Run the program with python3 and input how many times you'd like to generate a random number and this bad boy will do it's arcane magic!

This is the first program I've written in a near ten year hiatus from programming so I'm kinda proud of it tbh :) I made this thing run a billion times on my new iMac today hahaha.
